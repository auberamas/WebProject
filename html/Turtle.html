                <p class="box1">Sea turtles are among the most ancient living species on Earth, having first appeared over 100 million years ago, long before the age of dinosaurs. 
                    Today, they inhabit all tropical and subtropical oceans, playing crucial ecological roles across marine ecosystems. 
                    Yet, despite their evolutionary resilience, modern sea turtles face unprecedented threats, almost entirely driven by human activity.

                    <h2 > Ecological Importance</h2>
                    <p >Of the seven recognized species of sea turtles, six are listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered by the IUCN. 
                        These animals contribute significantly to ecosystem functioning: green turtles maintain healthy seagrass beds through grazing; 
                        hawksbill turtles help preserve coral reef balance by feeding on sponges; and leatherback turtles regulate jellyfish populations in pelagic food webs. 
                        The loss of sea turtles would thus trigger cascading effects across marine biodiversity.

                    <h2>A Complex and Fragile Life Cycle</h2>
                    <p >Sea turtles undergo a complex life cycle, migrating across thousands of kilometers between their nesting beaches and feeding grounds. 
                        Hatchlings face immediate dangers from predation and artificial lighting, which disorients them and reduces their chances of reaching the ocean. 
                        As adults, they must contend with a range of human-induced threats — including boat strikes, entanglement in industrial fishing gear, and degradation of coastal nesting sites.

                    <h2>Plastic Pollution and Climate Pressures</h2>
                    <p>Plastic pollution presents a particularly severe risk. 
                        Studies estimate that over 50% of sea turtles have ingested plastic debris, mistaking it for prey such as jellyfish. 
                        This can lead to intestinal blockages, malnutrition, or infection. Climate change compounds these pressures: sea-level rise erodes nesting habitats, while the temperature-dependent sex determination of embryos results in increasingly female-skewed populations. 
                        In some monitored areas, nearly 100% of hatchlings are now female — a trend that threatens the future reproductive viability of certain populations.

                    <h2>Scientific Advances in Conservation</h2>
                    <p>Scientific research has greatly advanced our understanding of sea turtle behavior and resilience. 
                        Satellite telemetry enables the tracking of long-distance migrations and identification of key habitats. 
                        Isotopic analysis reveals feeding ecology, while genomics sheds light on genetic diversity and population structures. 
                        Conservationists are also experimenting with adaptive management strategies: 
                        temperature-controlled hatcheries help rebalance sex ratios, and the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in fishing nets has significantly reduced bycatch in some regions.

                    <h2>Global and Local Conservation Efforts</h2>
                    <p>Field programs around the world — from loggerhead monitoring in Cape Verde to leatherback tracking in French Guiana — illustrate the growing integration of science and policy in turtle conservation. 
                        International cooperation, under frameworks like the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and regional Memoranda of Understanding, is essential to address the transboundary nature of sea turtle ecology.

                <h2 >A Broader Warning</h2>
                <p class="box1">Despite localized successes, the overall outlook remains alarming. Sea turtles are indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. 
                    Their decline is a warning signal of broader ocean degradation. 
                    Preserving these species demands urgent, coordinated efforts to reduce plastic waste, mitigate climate change, protect habitats, and rethink fishing practices. 
                    Sea turtles remind us that conservation is not only about saving iconic species — it is about preserving the delicate systems that sustain life in the oceans. Their fate is intimately tied to ours.
