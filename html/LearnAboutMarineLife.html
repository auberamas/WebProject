                <h2 >Ocean’s Vital Role</h2>
                <p class="box1">Covering over 70% of Earth's surface, the ocean is a cornerstone of life on our planet. It regulates climate, produces over half of the oxygen we breathe, and supports a vast array of biodiversity. Marine ecosystems are integral to global ecological balance and human well-being.
                (<a href="https://www.educations.com/articles-and-advice/bachelor-studies/twelve-interdisciplinary-studies-for-marine-conservation">Educations.com</a>)</p>

                <h2 ><a href="https://www.msc.org/en-au/what-we-are-doing/oceans-at-risk/marine-biodiversity">Marine Biodiversity: The Foundation of Ocean Health</a></h2>
                <p class="box1">Marine biodiversity encompasses the variety of life forms in the ocean, from microscopic plankton to the largest whales. This diversity ensures ecosystem resilience, productivity, and adaptability to environmental changes. Healthy marine biodiversity supports services such as food provision, carbon sequestration, and nutrient cycling.</p>

                    <h2 >Key Marine Ecosystems and Their Inhabitants</h2>

                    <h3 ><a href="./Coralreef.html">Coral Reefs</a></h3>
                    <p>Often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea," coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems. They provide habitat for approximately 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. Coral reefs offer coastal protection, support fisheries, and attract tourism.</p>

                    <h3 ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_rewilding">Mangroves and Seagrass Beds</a></h3>
                    <p>Mangrove forests and seagrass meadows are crucial coastal ecosystems. They serve as nurseries for many marine species, stabilize shorelines, and act as significant carbon sinks. Seagrass meadows, for instance, can sequester carbon at rates comparable to, or even exceeding, those of terrestrial forests.</p>

                    <h3 >Deep-Sea Ecosystems</h3>
                    <p>The deep sea, comprising areas below 200 meters, is home to unique ecosystems like hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. These environments host specialized organisms adapted to extreme conditions, many of which are still being discovered. The deep sea plays a role in global nutrient cycling and carbon storage.</p>

                    <h2>Threats to Marine Life</h2>

                    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_conservation">Overfishing</a></h3>
                    <p>Overexploitation of marine resources has led to the decline of many fish populations. The Food and Agriculture Organization reports that approximately 34% of global fish stocks are overfished, threatening food security and ecosystem balance.</p>

                    <h3>Pollution</h3>
                    <p>Marine pollution, including plastic debris, oil spills, and chemical runoff, adversely affects marine organisms and habitats. Microplastics have been found in a wide range of marine species, raising concerns about their impact on food webs and human health.</p>

                    <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                    <p>Rising ocean temperatures, acidification, and sea-level rise, driven by climate change, pose significant threats to marine ecosystems. Coral bleaching events, resulting from elevated sea temperatures, have caused widespread reef degradation. Ocean acidification affects calcifying organisms, such as corals and shellfish, impairing their growth and survival.</p>
