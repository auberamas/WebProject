                        Jellyfish, belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, have existed for over 500 million years, making them some of the oldest multicellular organisms on Earth. 
                        Their simple anatomy and adaptability have allowed them to survive multiple mass extinction events. However, recent environmental changes, many driven by human activities, 
                        are presenting new challenges to these gelatinous creatures. <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/05/17/jellyfish-could-be-one-marine-creature-that-benefits-from-climate-change">(euronews)</a>

                        <h2 > Climate Change: A Double-Edged Sword</h2>
                        <p >While jellyfish are often considered beneficiaries of climate change due to their tolerance for varying temperatures and low oxygen levels, the reality is more nuanced. 
                            Rising sea temperatures can accelerate their reproductive cycles, leading to more frequent blooms. 
                            For instance, studies have shown that warmer waters in the Mediterranean have led to increased jellyfish swarms, impacting local tourism and fisheries. 
                            However, extreme temperature fluctuations and marine heatwaves can also disrupt their life cycles and habitats, posing risks to their populations.

                        <h2>Pollution and Habitat Degradation</h2>
                        <p >Jellyfish are increasingly threatened by pollution, particularly microplastics. 
                            Research from the Monterey Bay Aquarium indicates that jellyfish can ingest microplastics, which not only harms them directly but also introduces these pollutants into the broader marine food web. 
                            Additionally, coastal development and habitat destruction reduce the availability of suitable environments for the polyp stage of jellyfish, crucial for their reproduction.

                        <h2>Overfishing: Disrupting the Balance</h2>
                        <p>Overfishing has led to the decline of many jellyfish predators, such as certain fish species and sea turtles. 
                            This imbalance can result in unchecked jellyfish population growth, leading to blooms that disrupt local ecosystems. 
                            However, the reduction in biodiversity also means that jellyfish lose essential components of their ecological networks, potentially affecting their long-term survival.

                        <h2>Human-Jellyfish Interactions: A Growing Concern</h2>
                        <p>Increased jellyfish blooms have led to more frequent human encounters, some of which are harmful. 
                            For example, between May and August 2024, nearly 7,500 people on Spain's Catalan coast required medical attention for jellyfish stings, a 41% increase from the previous year. 
                            Such incidents highlight the need for better public awareness and management strategies to mitigate human-jellyfish conflicts.

                    <p class="box1">
                        Jellyfish are resilient and have adapted to Earth's changing environments for millions of years. 
                        However, the rapid pace of current environmental changes poses significant threats to their populations. 
                        By understanding and addressing the challenges they face, we can help ensure that jellyfish continue to thrive as integral components of marine ecosystems.
